What screen sizes are supported by bootstrap?

Please describe what would be the output of the following code snippet on iphone 5 and on desktop computer, when using Twitter Bootstrap?  What would you expect to see?

```
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Ruby Red</div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Navy Blue</div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Lime Green</div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">Egg Nog</div>
    </div>
```

### Solution here please ...

phones, less than 768px
tablets, 768px and up
desktops, 992px and up
large desktops, 1200px and up


You should see 4 equal width horizontal rows of the appropriate color. On iphon5 this should more or less take the entire screen but on desktop it should leave a lot of whitespace.
