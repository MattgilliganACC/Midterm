3. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?



1. Git allows for good record keeping of what changes were made and when, and it will also keep up best practices for when transitioning to team work.

2. It allows multiple people to work meaningfully on the same file simultaneously, while also allowing experimentation without affecting the 'master' code

3. Fetch downloads new data from a remote repository but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. Pull is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.
